## Part 1: Building a simple pentest tool
You will write a script (pentest.py) containing a set of Python functions (tasks), which will be invoked via a main 
menu. This script is your source file, which should be executed on a command console without use of any Python IDE.
Your script will contain the tasks that are explained in the below table. When you execute the script, a menu will be
displayed from which you will choose a task to perform.



## Part 2: Secure Authentication
Now write a set of functions in a source file, which will implement a hybrid authentication
system with digital signature shown in the following figure. The program,<b>secAuth.py</b> will read
the sender’s ID from <b>ID.txt</b> file, which contains full citizen registration data (kimlik bilgilerinin
tamamı), sign it and send to destination. The destination will then verify the ID of the source.
Please, note that <b>KH</b>is defined as <b>KH = XOR(KRx, KUx)</b>.
